## How to use DigiDiary!
Users will first make an account when clicking on "Register". The username must not be already taken, and the password must be at least 6 characters long, have at least one letter, and have at least one special character from a preselected sort. Once successfully logged in, the user will have access to creating diaries and viewing old diaries.

At the top of the page, there is a navbar, which users can use to view the 3D model of the room, create a new diary entry, view any previous diary entries, and also change their password at the settings tab.

When arrived at the 3d model, use your cursor and click and drag to rotate the room and/or to zoom in and out of the model.

The "Create" tab at the top will lead users to a page where they are allowed to create new diary entries. Users must input a corresponding date for the entry (which they may do so from a calendar date and time selector), a title for the entry, a description of their day, and an overall mood to describe their day. After pressing the create button, users will be redirected to the entries page, where they are able to view the entry they just submitted, and any previous entries if they exist.

The "Settings" tab leads users to a page that allows them to change their password, by clicking on a change password button which leads them to a form where they are able to enter in their old password and enter in a new password they would like to have it set to.

The logout button at the top right allows users to log out of the website securely once they are done with the diary!
